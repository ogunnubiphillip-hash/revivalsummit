   data-bio="Rev. (Dr.) Mike Oye is a name that resonates like a heartbeat through the history of 
   Nigerian revival, a living bridge between generations of fire. Born in 1939 of Nigerian parentage 
   and raised in Ghana, he encountered Christ powerfully as a young man and never looked back. He became 
   a leader of campus revival movements in the 1960s and ’70s, most notably as President of the Ibadan 
   Varsity Christian Union and the first Indigenous Traveling Secretary of Scripture Union in Nigeria 
   (1966–1972), carrying the gospel to secondary schools, tertiary institutions, and all walks of society.
   His ministry is marked by holiness, conviction, and love, he isn’t just a speaker of verses but a life 
   formed by them, impacting names many young ministers today know as fathers in faith. A lifelong evangelist, 
   teacher, and mentor, Papa Mike’s influence helped shape the evangelistic zeal of ministers across denominational 
   lines and continues to be a beacon for revival and spiritual depth across generations.">

   as the Founder of CAPRO Missions, a movement committed to advancing the gospel among unreached peoples 
   and strengthening the missionary vision of the Church. His life’s work reflects a rare blend of 
   apostolic courage, pastoral tenderness, and unwavering devotion to Christ’s global mandate.Through 
   CAPRO Missions, Rev’d Famonure has helped mobilise, train, and send countless missionaries into 
   difficult and often neglected fields, carrying the light of the gospel where it is least known. 
   His leadership is marked not by personal prominence but by sacrificial obedience and kingdom focus, 
   demonstrating that true spiritual authority flows from surrender rather than status. Under his 
   guidance, the missions movement has nurtured believers who embody resilience, cultural sensitivity, 
   and deep spiritual conviction.
   Beyond missionary enterprise, he remains a teacher of sound doctrine and builder of mature disciples, 
   consistently calling the Church back to holiness, consecration, and wholehearted service. His counsel 
   has steadied leaders, strengthened churches, and inspired younger generations to embrace lives poured 
   out for God’s eternal purposes.
   Rev’d Famonure’s legacy is written across nations and peoples; in lives transformed, communities 
   reached, and missionaries raised. He stands as a living reminder that revival must ultimately move 
   beyond gatherings into the sacrificial obedience of going, until the knowledge of Christ fills the 
   earth.">

   data-image="images/speakers/speaker-5.jpg"
   data-bio="Pastor Poju Oyemade is one of Nigeria’s most compelling voices of biblical clarity 
   and generational impact. Born in Ibadan on May 8, 1968, he blends deep spiritual insight with 
   intellectual rigor, having studied Applied Physics and Electronics at the University of Lagos 
   before surrendering fully to ministry.

   In 1994, with the ordination of Bishop David Oyedepo, he launched The Covenant Nation (TCN) (formerly 
   Covenant Christian Centre) a ministry rooted in identity, transformation, and the practical application 
   of the Word of God. What began as a humble gathering has flourished into a vibrant, multi-centre 
   congregation that thrives on discipleship, purpose, and everyday relevance.
   Pastor Poju is widely known as a bridge between generations, between the older guard of faith 
   leaders and emerging voices, between spiritual wisdom and practical living. His teaching resounds 
   across national platforms, impacting families, professionals, and leaders in business and public 
   life alike. His ministry convenes flagship gatherings like the West Africa Faith Believers Convention 
   (WAFBEC), The Platform Nigeria, and the International Conference for Pastors and Leaders, shaping a 
   generation that marries biblical truth with national influence.
   Beyond the pulpit, he champions innovation, utilizing media, television, and digital spaces to 
   spread hope. For many, Pastor Poju is not merely a teacher, he is a spiritual father whose voice 
   echoes across the landscape of modern ministry in Nigeria and beyond.">

   data-bio="Dr David Ogbueli is widely recognised as a transformational leader whose ministry blends 
   spiritual depth, intellectual clarity, and societal relevance. As a pastor, teacher, and visionary,

   to understand Scripture in ways that inspire both devotion and decisive action. Dr Ogbueli 
   consistently calls the Church toward maturity, urging believers to embody Christlike character

   into social transformation, ethical leadership, and compassionate service.
   Those who encounter his ministry often describe a renewed sense of purpose, courage, and 
   disciplined faith. He carries the conviction that revival must ultimately produce reformed 
   lives and restored societies, not merely emotional moments. Through decades of faithful labour, 
   Dr Ogbueli’s voice continues to guide a generation seeking authentic spirituality anchored in truth

   data-bio="Engineer Steve Olumuyiwa represents the powerful convergence of professional excellence 
   and uncompromising Christian conviction. Trained within the discipline of engineering yet devoted 
   to kingdom service, his life demonstrates that the marketplace can become a vibrant arena for 
   spiritual influence and godly leadership.
   Across years of corporate and ministerial engagement, he has emphasised integrity, diligence, and 
   servant leadership as the hallmarks of believers positioned in secular spaces. His voice encourages 
   professionals to see their vocations not merely as careers, but as divine assignments through which 
   righteousness, innovation, and compassion can shape society.
   As a mentor and speaker, Engineer Olumuyiwa invests in emerging leaders navigating faith within 
   competitive environments. He provides wisdom on balancing ambition with humility, success with 
   stewardship, and influence with accountability; forming individuals who shine as ethical lights 
   within complex systems.
   His contribution to revival conversations is uniquely strategic: a reminder that national 
   transformation requires not only church renewal but redeemed leadership in business, technology, 
   and governance. Through steady witness and practical guidance, he embodies the truth that when 
   faith permeates work, ordinary professions become instruments of extraordinary kingdom impact.">
